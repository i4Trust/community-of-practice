# Community of Practice

You can contact us on the FIWARE Community on Discord. Concretely, you may want to run a live conversation with us in 
one of the following channels:

* [data-space-connector](https://discord.gg/UahV9Crv3Q), where to carry out real-time discussions about the 
  FIWARE Data Space Connector

  about the FIWARE Data Space Connector as a Service Testing and Experimentation Facility (DSCaaS TEF) 
* [trust-and-decentralized-iam](https://discord.gg/WtBvSVhQS6), where to carry out real-time discussions about FIWARE 
  components implementing trust, identity management and access control. These components are planned to be used in different 
  projects (e.g., DOME) but are core components of the FIWARE Data Space Connector
* [trading-marketplace](https://discord.gg/ZVtTVTsF8Y), where to carry out real-time discussions about FIWARE components 
  implementing marketplace functions. These components are planned to be used in different projects (e.g., DOME) but are core

* [ishare-i4trust-collaboration](https://discord.gg/ZfkEJNmf34) (channel), where to carry out real-time discussions about usage 
  of iSHARE building blocks in combination with the FIWARE Data Space Connector for creation of data spaces. Links to iSHARE 
  Community tools (see next sections) will be include there.
* [ishare-i4trust-collaboration](https://discord.gg/FxFKtCQQzp) (forum), configured as a forum where to consolidate answers about 
  the i4Trust collaboration program and the combined usage of FIWARE and iSHARE building blocks.

Experiments funded under the initial phase of the i4Trust collaboration program formulated questions you may found solved already. 
They can be found in 
this [i4Trust Helpdesk](https://spaces.fundingbox.com/spaces/i4trust-i4trust-helpdesk) space of the old community platform we had setup. 
We will be copying relevant questions and their response to 
the [ishare-i4trust-collaboration](https://discord.gg/FxFKtCQQzp) forum.

In addition, iSHARE has following tools/channels for its community engagement and these channels are open for participants of i4trust as well as potential participants inspired by i4trust portfolio and/or framework and willing to create dataspaces or implement it in their dataspaces:
* [iSHARE forum](https://forum.ishare.eu) where various topics are present and additional topics will be created and updated to make community management efficient. iSHARE will create dedicated topics for i4Trust where participants willing to use FIWARE building blocks for data spaces will be also able to explore the FIWARE community on Discord and interact there.
* [iSHARE support portal](https://support.ishare.eu) where all the learnings from participants of iSHARE are being regularly curated leading to enhancing the knowledgebase for fellow participants to learn from others thereby fostering community practice and collaborations. Additionally, it is also a way for participants to request support needed from iSHARE towards them. Questions dedicatedly coming for i4Trust related topics will be co-addressed by iSHARE and FIWARE experts to help the community appropriately.
* [iSHARE slack channels](https://join.slack.com/t/ishare-eu/shared_invite/zt-26q74saoj-r8jRjSNgvHx2wpv34iBZXQ) are used by all data spaces to work closely together and continuously find new opportunities for collaboration. 
* [iSHARE Change Management](https://changes.ishare.eu) process enables data spaces to directly influence the further development of the iSHARE Trust Framework to accommodate the needs of data spaces. 

Together these form a solid collaboration ground for participants to share, learn and contribute on the topic of dataspaces using iSHARE framework.
